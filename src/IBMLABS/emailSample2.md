This week, be sure you have signed up and spend some time with the specific, free, and deep dive training for you to learn about the use cases and reference patterns that you can deploy on IBM Cloud at developer.ibm.com/callforcode. There's focus on areas like AI, Cloud, IoT, and Blockchain and will help you build up your knowledge and skills to get ready for our Call for Code day.

Call for Code is a fantastic way for you to get new skills while working towards solving one of mankind's biggest problems. I'm looking forward to kicking off our organization's contributions in our upcoming event.
