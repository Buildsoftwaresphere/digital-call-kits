Team,

A little while ago I reached out to you about an incredibly worthwhile developer challenge called Call for Code. It's a global developer challenge to improve natural disaster preparedness. Supporting the UN Human Rights office, and The International Network of The American Red Cross, with the technology being provided for free by IBM. There's a whole host of incredible prizes including deploying on-site in countries that desperately need ways to save lives.

If you've not yet singed up, now is the time!

I wanted to bring to your attention that there is specific, free, and deep dive training for those who are building projects for Call for Code found at developer.ibm.com/callforcode. It focuses on areas like AI, Cloud, IoT, and Blockchain and will help you build up your qualifications while you build out your solutions. There's a wide community of developers who are working on solving this pressing issue, many of whom are looking for teammates!

Call for Code is a tangible way for you to get your hands on IBM Watson and Blockchain technologies. I'm personally fascinated with how blockchain is going to be changing the world and I'd love to hear what you're working on!

Call for Code is a fantastic way for you to get new skills while working towards solving one of the biggest problems facing mankind.
