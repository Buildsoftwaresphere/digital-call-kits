**What I need to do to help Amplify the Call for Code?**  
Take a few moments to review the material in this digital kit to help you have the discussion with your social networks, colleagues, clients, friends, and family. If you have more questions, feel free to check out the full FAQ at http://ibm.biz/CallforCodeFAQ . We need you can be an ambassador for IBM in support of the Call for Code, it's fast and easy.

**Why is this initiative important?**  
On average, **every day** natural disasters will directly impact 80,000 people, costing the global economy more than $270 million. What if technology could help improve these figures? That's exactly what Call for Code is setting out to do. It asks developers to work out how to use AI, Blockchain, Cloud, Data, and IoT technologies most effectively to improve communities' disaster preparedness and resiliency. Call for Code is supporting the UN Human Rights office, and The International Network of The American Red Cross, and projects will be built on IBM Cloud.

**How should the Call for Code be represented?**  
In written form: Call for Code (two capital C's) or CALL FOR CODE.
It should NOT be represented as c4c, CfC, CALLFORCODE, callforcode (without .org on the end) or any variation other than that outlined above. The logo has several colors that can be used, no other variation or greyscale can be used. The logo should always be used in conjunction with the words. In social media, use #CallforCode

**Are there some social media message examples that I can use/adapt?**  
Use the hashtag #CallforCode on social media.

**What else can I do?**  
Once you receive the names of those who have volunteered their time, there is potentially some dedicated time that could be given to those individuals. They may also reach out to you as the person who sends the emails with questions, fielding them to the callforcode.slack.com would work. But you can be as hands-on as you'd like!
